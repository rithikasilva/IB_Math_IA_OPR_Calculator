# IB_Math_IA_OPR_Calculator

Code is for my math IA. Currently calculates the 2019 OPR values for teams in ontario and compares against real match scores of the district championship.
This code is non modular as this is specifically for one class assignment, and thus needs to be simple. A proper calculator is in the works.
